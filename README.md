# rMp
A Rate My Professor extension for the University of Michigan. Integrated into Atlas and the Course Guide.

# About
When it comes to scheduling classes, it's important to find the right professor in order to succeed. RateMyProfessors provides a valuable tool to gauge if a professor is good or not, but it's annoying switching between tabs all the time when scheduling.
That's why this RateMyProfessors extension is the perfect tool to solve this!

**Diclaimer**: At the moment this only works on Chrome...sorry
